### Project overview
---
The data analysis project aims to explore and evaluate loan data to understand patterns and factors
affecting loan approval, default rates and repayment behaviors. This analysis will utilize historical loan
data to identify key factors influencing the loan process, such as borrower characteristics, loan types 
and financial indicators. By applying various data analysis techniques, the project seeks to provide valuable 
insight into the loan approval process, the risk of default factor that influence loan repayment.
### Tools 
To conduct the loan analysis, i utilized Excel, a powerful and versatile tool that i am highly proficient in.
Excel allowed me to efficiently manage and clean large datasets, aply various analytical techniques and
create detailed visualization to uncover insights. Through advanced features like pivot tables, VLOOKUP,
conditional formatting, and charting, i was able to identify patterns and trends in the loan data that informed
key decisions. While Excel may seem basic at first glance, its abilty to handle complex analyses and deliver actionable
results makes it an indispensable tool for this type of projecct


### Data visualization
In this analysis, i used data visualization to bring the key findings to life and communicate insights
more effectively. By leveraging various chart, graph and plot, i was able to present complex loan data 
in an easily digestible format. for example bar chat were used to compare total customers with job, 
age group of total customers and educational status of total customers while pie chart was used to 
compare marital status of total customers, housing of total customers, total customers that defauted and 
contact of total customers. These visualization not only helps in identifying trends and patterns at 
a glance but also make the analysis more accesible for decision-makers to draw actionable insight from the 
use of colour, labels and clear axes ensures that the visualizations are both informative and intuitive.

### Result/findings
- Customers with blue-collar job patronizes the bank the most
- Age group with the highest patronage is adult
- 56% of the customers defaulted in thier loan while 44% didnt.
- The average age of the total customer is 41.
### Reccomendation
Given that  borrowers with low credit scores and higher debt to income ratio have a significantly
higher likelihood of defaulting, I recommend implementing a more stringent credit evaluation process 
that include aditional metrics like employment history and outstanding debts. This would help in 
identifyinng potential high risk applicants early on, allowing the company to make more imformed
lending decisions and potentially reduce the overall default rate.
